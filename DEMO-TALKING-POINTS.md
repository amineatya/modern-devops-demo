  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        canary:
          exact: "true"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: cicd-demo
        subset: canary
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: cicd-demo
        subset: stable
```

**Business Impact:** "This allows us to do canary deployments with zero downtime and automatic rollback if issues are detected."

### **Distributed Tracing (Jaeger)**

```javascript
// Custom business tracing
const span = tracer.startSpan('user-registration');
span.setTag('user.id', userId);
span.setTag('business.operation', 'registration');
// ... business logic
span.finish();
```

**Business Impact:** "We can trace a user registration from the frontend through authentication, database operations, and email notifications - all in one view."

    msg := "Containers must not run as root"
}
```

**Business Impact:** "We prevent security misconfigurations before they reach production."

### **Container Security**

**Technical Implementation:**
```dockerfile
# Security-hardened container
FROM node:20-alpine AS production
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nodejs -u 1001
USER nodejs
```

**Business Impact:** "Zero security vulnerabilities in production."

**Custom Metrics:**
```javascript
// Business metrics
const businessMetrics = {
  userRegistrations: new prometheus.Counter({
    name: 'user_registrations_total',
    help: 'Total number of user registrations'
  }),
  apiResponseTime: new prometheus.Histogram({
    name: 'api_response_time_seconds',
    help: 'API response time in seconds'
  })
};
```

**Business Impact:** "We can detect issues before they impact users and make data-driven decisions."

### **Alerting Strategy**
**"Proactive incident response..."**

**Alert Types:**
- **Critical:** Immediate notification for failures
- **Warning:** Proactive notification for potential issues
- **Info:** Informational notifications
- **Cost:** Budget threshold alerts

**Business Impact:** "Mean time to detection reduced from hours to minutes."
